## Inception Phase

### Context
Being able to identify someone by their face is globally used in normal day life, but when we try and categorise people in a certain company, or enterprise, it is not always easy. Inserting a photo anywhere is not the main problem, but assuring that when updating it with a new photo, it’s valid and usable can get tricky. Therefore, the search for a way to upload new photos and validate it with new/better algorithms that prevent any backlash is highly requested.

### Problem
Our project will consist of a mobile application that sends a photo to an API which will respond with characteristics of that photo (Ex.: Has a face, has glasses…) and, according to the response message, the mobile app will check if it’s valid and update it to the database.

### Goals
- Facial Recognition functionalities
- Improve existing algorithms in FotoFaces
- Add algorithms to FotoFaces to improve the reliability of the Facial Recognition
- Implement deep learning to make the FotoFaces algorithms more reliable

### Risks
- Modularization Problems
- Performance and Efficiency of the algorithms
- Bad implementation of deep learning

### Expected Results
- Fully functional mobile app with FotoFaces integration
- Reliable Facial Recognition
- Robust backend capable of scaling
